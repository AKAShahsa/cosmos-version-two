## 🎵 Advanced Music Player Features - Implementation Complete!

### 🚀 Feature Summary
Your YouTube Music Player now includes all 5 requested advanced features:

#### 1. ✅ **Real-time Sync for Mid-Song Joiners**
- **Backend**: Enhanced sync logic in `App.tsx` and `RoomContext.tsx`
- **How it works**: When users join mid-song, they automatically sync to the current playback time
- **Code**: `updateCurrentTime()` function broadcasts time updates to all members

#### 2. ✅ **Playlist Remove Functionality**
- **Backend**: `removeFromPlaylist()` function in RoomContext
- **Frontend**: Delete buttons in PlayerControls playlist section (trash icon)
- **Access**: Host-only feature - only room hosts can remove tracks

#### 3. ✅ **Player Controls with Progress & Volume**
- **Component**: `PlayerControls.tsx` - Full-featured player interface
- **Features**: 
  - Progress bar with seek functionality (host-only)
  - Volume control with mute toggle
  - Play/pause controls
  - Real-time time display (MM:SS format)
- **Mobile**: Native HTML5 sliders with custom styling

#### 4. ✅ **Host Transfer Capability**
- **Backend**: `transferHost()` function in RoomContext
- **Frontend**: "Make Host" buttons in member management section
- **Security**: Only current host can transfer to other members
- **UI**: Crown icon shows current host, UserCheck icon for transfer action

#### 5. ✅ **Room Persistence & Leave Confirmation**
- **Auto-reconnect**: `useRoomPersistence` hook saves room state to localStorage
- **Session management**: 24-hour session timeout
- **Leave confirmation**: Browser back button and page close warnings
